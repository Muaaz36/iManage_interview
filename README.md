# iManage_interview
This is an attempt on the iManage DevOps Engineer interview.
This project aims to create a t2.micro EC2 instance resource on a Linux distro using Terraform. It installs Nginx during the initial boot, and attaches a security group that allows ingress on port 80. Finally it outputs the public IP of this instance.
